## MedasDigital 2.0 Launch: A Phased Validator and Node Approach

To ensure a stable and seamless start, we’re launching MedasDigital 2.0 with a set of our own initial validators. This approach allows us to closely monitor network stability, optimize performance, and ensure a secure environment for all participants.

### Why Start with Our Own Validators?

- **Stability and Reliability**: By beginning with our own validators, we maintain complete control over network stability during the critical early phase, minimizing potential issues.
- **Security Optimization**: Launching with our validators allows us to monitor security metrics closely and make any necessary adjustments before opening the network to external participants.
- **Gradual Decentralization**: Shortly after launch, we’ll expand validator and node access, enabling community members to join and contribute to network growth.

### Join MedasDigital 2.0 as a Validator or Node

Very soon after the initial launch, everyone interested in supporting MedasDigital 2.0 can set up their own **validator** or **node** with our **Automated Setup Script**. This script simplifies the process, allowing participants to join as a validator for full participation in network security or as a node operator if they prefer not to validate actively.

By starting with a phased approach, MedasDigital 2.0 aims to build a stable, secure, and progressively decentralized network from the beginning. Stay tuned for updates on how to set up your own validator or node with our easy-to-use setup tools. We look forward to building the future of MedasDigital 2.0 together!
