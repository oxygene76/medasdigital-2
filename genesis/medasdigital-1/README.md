# Medas Digital 1.0 to Medas Digital 2.0 Transition Plan

This document explains the transition from **Medas Digital 1.0** (chain-id: `medasdigital-1`) to **Medas Digital 2.0** (chain-id: `medasdigital-2`), including the migration of key parameters and balances, as well as the adjustments made to improve the network from the start. **Medas Digital 2.0** will launch using **Cosmos SDK 0.50.10**.

## Overview

The **Medas Digital 1.0** blockchain, launched with the chain-id `medasdigital-1`, was the first iteration of the Medas Digital network. Over time, we have gathered valuable experience, but we've also identified areas for improvement. As we migrate to **Medas Digital 2.0** (chain-id: `medasdigital-2`), we are taking the opportunity to address several issues and enhance the overall performance, security, and functionality of the network.

The key objectives of this transition are:
1. **Preserving user balances and important parameters** from Medas Digital 1.0.
2. **Adjusting certain parameters** to optimize the network.
3. **Introducing improvements** such as enhanced governance, inflation adjustments, and module integrations from the beginning.

## What We Are Migrating

### 1. User Balances
We are preserving all user balances from **Medas Digital 1.0**. This means that all accounts with balances in the native `umedas` token will retain their holdings in the **Medas Digital 2.0** chain. The total supply of the `umedas` token at launch will reflect the final balances from the **Medas Digital 1.0** chain.

### 2. Key Parameters
Certain parameters that were successful in **Medas Digital 1.0** will be carried over to **Medas Digital 2.0** with minor adjustments. This includes:

- **Minting Parameters**: Inflation, total supply, and token economics will remain similar, with minor adjustments to improve long-term sustainability.
- **Slashing and Staking Parameters**: Validator and staking parameters will be reviewed to ensure optimal performance and security.
- **Governance**: Quorum, voting period, and deposit requirements will be adjusted to enhance community involvement and streamline decision-making.
  
### 3. Distribution and Rewards
The **community tax**, proposer rewards, and other distribution parameters will be refined to create a more balanced incentive structure for validators and delegators.

## What We Are Improving

### 1. Adjusted Inflation and Minting
In **Medas Digital 1.0**, inflation played a key role in token supply dynamics. However, for **Medas Digital 2.0**, we have adjusted the inflation parameters to strike a better balance between maintaining the network’s security and minimizing inflationary pressures. The total token supply will also be capped at **1 billion** `umedas` tokens.

- **Maximum Inflation**: Reduced from 25% to a more sustainable level.
- **Initial Inflation Rate**: Set to support network growth without devaluing existing holdings.

### 2. Improved Governance Mechanisms
Governance plays a crucial role in the network’s evolution. In **Medas Digital 2.0**, we are:
- **Lowering the minimum deposit** required to submit a proposal, encouraging more participation.
- **Adjusting the quorum and voting periods** to ensure decisions are made in a timely manner while still allowing for sufficient debate and discussion.

### 3. Better Validator and Staking Parameters
We are adjusting the validator set size and delegation parameters to:
- Improve decentralization by allowing more validators to participate.
- Provide greater rewards for long-term stakers while reducing risks of centralization.

### 4. Slashing Adjustments
In **Medas Digital 1.0**, slashing was essential for ensuring validator honesty. In **Medas Digital 2.0**, we will fine-tune slashing parameters to ensure they are strict enough to prevent misbehavior, while not being overly punitive.

### 5. New Module Integrations
**Medas Digital 2.0** will launch with integrated modules such as:
- **WASM Smart Contracts**: Enabling advanced decentralized applications.
- **TokenFactory**: Allowing users to create their own tokens directly on the chain.
- **NFT Module**: Supporting the creation and trading of NFTs on the Medas Digital 2.0 chain.

## Key Adjustments for Medas Digital 2.0

To enhance the new chain's functionality and security from the beginning, the following parameters will be adjusted:

- **Inflation**: Initial inflation will be adjusted to promote steady growth without over-inflating the supply.
- **Governance**: Governance parameters will be fine-tuned to ensure more community participation and faster decision-making.
- **Validator Set**: We will allow for more validators to participate, promoting decentralization and network resilience.
- **Slashing**: The slashing rules will be re-evaluated to ensure they are fair but effective in maintaining network security.
- **Distribution**: We are refining community tax and rewards to ensure fair distribution of earnings and incentives.

## Conclusion

The transition to **Medas Digital 2.0** is designed to preserve the value and strengths of **Medas Digital 1.0**, while also addressing known issues and integrating new features to make the network more scalable, secure, and user-friendly from the start. The new chain will launch with **Cosmos SDK 0.50.10** to take advantage of the latest improvements.

We welcome feedback from the community and encourage users to participate in the governance process to help shape the future of Medas Digital.
